<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Overview of Employment Distribution</h3>
<p>In order to have an overview of employment distribution according to different occupations in New York City, a Cleveland Dot Plot was drawn to show the 10-year-average of number of employed first.<br />

</ol>
<ul>
<li>There is a huge difference in number of employed among occupations. The sector with the biggest number of employed is office and administrative support, and the number of employed is 757015. However, for farming, fishing and forestry, which has the smallest number of employed, there’s only 4864 on average.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>first</strong> group includes <code>Office and administrative support</code>, <code>Management</code>, <code>Sales and related</code>, which is a group with the biggest number of employed.</li>
<li>The <strong>second</strong> group includes the majority of occupations and have relatively similar number of employed among occupations.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Analysis on Employment by Years</h3>
<p>Employment tends to change over time. So one area of analysis that was performed was to examine employment throughout the years 2010-2019.</p>
<div id="general-trend-of-employment-by-years" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2.1</span> General Trend of Employment by Years</h4>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/Aggregate%20Yearly%20Cleveland%20Dot%20Plot%20filtered%20into%203%20years-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p><strong>Observations on Number Employed by Occupation NYC through 2010-2019:</strong></p>
<p>The most striking observations from this Cleveland dot plot are where there are clear trends over the decade, that coincide with intuition about the general trend of a sector. Some of the most striking trends are:<br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  1.) Production occupations steadily decreasing over the course of the decade, the only sector where the number of employees for 2010 is lowest of the three years.</div>
<div class="line-block">  2.) Material moving occupations steadily increasing over the course of the decade.</div>
<div class="line-block">  3.) Computer and mathematical as well as architecture and engineering occupations quite quickly increasing over the course of the decade especially relative to their size.</div>
<div class="line-block">  4.) Health care support occupations growing at a stagnant rate from 2010 to 2015, but then growing rapidly from 2015 to 2019.</div>
<div class="line-block">  5.) Food preparation and serving related occupations growing steadily from 2010 to 2019.</div>
<p>In order to see the employment variances of the 25 occupations in detail, a boxplot is drawn.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/Yearly%20BoxPlot-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p><strong>Observations from Boxplot of number working in sector per year:</strong></p>
<p>Occupations that seem prone to dramatic fluctuation over time:<br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  1.) Management occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  2.) Office and administrative support occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  3.) Health care support occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  4.) Computer and Mathematical occupations</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Occupations where the number of employees has fluctuated very little:<br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  1.)Law enforcement</div>
<div class="line-block">  2.)Fire fighting</div>
<div class="line-block">  3.)Building and grounds keeping occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  4.)Legal occupations</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Something to be noted when reading this plot is that the number of people working in any particular occupation may change the viewers perception as to what constitutes more variation. To address this, a second plot has been created in which the box plots are normalized by dividing the number employed in each year by the mean across this sector. While the variation in total number employed won’t be apparent, the relative degrees of fluctuation will become more apparent.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/Yearly%20Normalized%20BoxPlot-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p><strong>Observations from number working in sector per year:</strong></p>
<p>In this plot, the total values of employees working in each field in each year are normalized by their averages. In doing this, changes in employment in a sector that on an absolute scale would be small, may be more pronounced as a function of variation relative to it’s own size.</p>
<p>In this plot, the average quantity across all years is normalized to one for illustrative purposes, which allows for new interpretations and findings:</p>
<p>1.) Fields such as management which had a large absolute spread from the years 2010-2019 aren’t necessarily the ones which seem to display the most variation with respect to themselves. While management had the largest box in the previous plot, it is in the middle of the pack in this one.</p>
<p>2.) Of the fields with the smallest numbers of workers: Farming, fishing and forestry occupations, Life, physical and social science occupations, Law enforcement occupations, firefighting occupations, and architecture and engineering occupations; The spreads across this decade were shown to be much more profound than in the previous plot, that is with the exception of law enforcement workers and firefighting workers. While the boxes grew somewhat in spread, the growth was not even nearly proportional to that of the other fields.</p>
<p>This indicates that the number of people working in law enforcement and firefighting is very stable, and this would make sense because a steady supply of people in these roles is necessary. With regards to the other occupations, it also makes sense that relatively unpopulated occupations would be more prone to greater variation as a percent of itself, since relatively few can leave or join, and a big impact can be had.</p>
<p>3.) As a percent of the number of employees working in each sector, the following were most prone to large shifts in number employed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farming, fishing and forestry</li>
<li>Material moving occupations</li>
<li>Computer and mathematical occupations</li>
<li>Health technologists and technicians</li>
<li>Healthcare support occupations</li>
</ul>
<p>By contrast, these professions were the most stable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal occupations</li>
<li>Sales occupations</li>
<li>Law enforcement workers</li>
<li>Fire fighters</li>
<li>Construction and extraction occupations<br />
</li>
</ul>

<div id="monotonicity-in-employment-trends" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2.2</span> Monotonicity in Employment Trends</h4>
<p>From the yearly cleveland dot plot above, all occupations are divided into three categories. The first group is in a monotonous increasing trend, the second group is in a monotonic decreasing trend, and the third group do not have a monotonic trend in number of employed people by years.</p>
<p><strong>Monotonically Increasing:</strong></p>
<p>Within this group are 14 kinds of occupations:<br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  1. Management Occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  2. Healthcare support occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  3. Business and financial operations occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  4. Computer and mathematical occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  5. Education, training and library occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  6. Art, design, entertainment, sports and media occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  7. Health, design and treating practitioners and other technical occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  8. Construction and extraction occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  9. Architecture and engineering occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  10. Fire fighting and prevention, and other protective service workers including supervisors<br />

<div class="line-block">  13. Law enforcement workers including supervisors</div>
<div class="line-block">  14. Farming, fishing and forestry occupations</div>
<p><br />
<strong>Monotonically Decreasing:</strong></p>
<p>Within this group is only one kind of occupation:<br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  1. Production occupations</div>
<p><br />
<strong>Not Monotonic:</strong></p>
<p>Within this group are 10 different occupations:<br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  1. Office and administrative support occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  2. Food preparation and serving related occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  3. Transportation occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  4. Material moving occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  5. Health technologists and technicians</div>
<div class="line-block">  6. Personal care and service occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  7. Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  8. Sales and related occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  9. Legal occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  10. Installation, maintenance, and repair occupations</div>
<p><br />
Further study is conducted on the group that does not a monotonic trend with line chart.</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="960" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><strong>Observations from sectors without clear employment trends:</strong></p>
<p>Here are descriptions of how these sectors have fluctuated:<br />
<br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  1. Office and administrative support occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">      The number of employees in this group was consistently high before 2017, while from 2017 to 2019, the number of employees dropped dramatically.</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  2. Food preparation and serving related occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">      In this group, the peak of the number of employees were present in 2015.</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  3. Transportation occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">      Generally speaking, the number of employees was increasing. However, from 2018 to 2019, there was a rather pronounced drop, which is the reason that the number of employed in 2019 was smaller than that in 2015.</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  4. Material moving occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">      For this group, the number of employees dropped slightly from 2010 to 2011, then increased from 2011 to 2012. Afterwards, the number of employees started to decrease again until 2016. Then there was a sudden increase from 2016 to 2018 and maintained at a high level in 2019 with a subtle decrease.</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  5. Health technologists and technicians</div>
<div class="line-block">      The number of employees was consistently low from 2010 to 2013. Then the number started to increase until 2015 and maintained a relatively high level afterwards. Despite frequent dips and spikes, it seems that the number of employees in this occupation is trending upward on the whole.</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  6. Personal care and service occupations</div>

<p><strong>Observations from sector groups employment across counties:</strong><br />
<br />
Observing this plot, it can be seen that certain counties stand out in terms of how many of their people work in certain areas:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>New York has great representation in Management, business, science, and arts with roughly 60% of its population routinely working in those fields across 2010-2019, which is at roughly 15% higher than for any other county.</p></li>
<li><p>Bronx County has great representation in service occupations, with roughly 35% of its population working routinely in this sector, which is at least 10% higher than for any other county.</p></li>
<li><p>Richmond County and Queens County seem to have good representation in natural resources, construction, and maintenance occupations.</p></li>
<li><p>New York, perhaps because of the high representation in the management, business, science, and arts cluster has clearly the lowest representation in service, natural resources, construction and maintenance, and production, transportation, management and material moving. New York also has the lowest representation in several years in Sales and Office occupations.</p></li>
<li><p>Of all the counties, Queens county, Kings county, and Richmond county seem to track each other most, and have the most similar levels of representation across the sector clusters.</p></li>
<li><p>Of all the counties, New York county and Bronx county seem to be the most different. Across almost each sector, low values for one almost certainly means that high values will appear for the other.<br />

<p><strong>Observations from Race Proportions by Sector Given Equal Populations:</strong><br />
<br />
Note: This plot was formed by comparing the proportions of each race group working in each sector. If for a particular sector each group accounts for 0.25 in this plot, then each race group has the same percentage of its people working in that sector. This has the effect of displaying what the race demographics of a sector would look like assuming all races had the same population.<br />
<br />
1.) It seems that a typical white person is much more likely than persons of other races to work legal profession compared to other races. They are also quite likely compared to other races to engage in Management occupations, physical, life and social science occupations, and art, design, entertainment, sports and media occupations. <br />
</p>
<p>2.) It seems that a typical white person is much less likely than persons of other races to work in health care support occupations, transportation occupations, production occupations, personal care and service occupations, material moving operations, and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations <br />
</p>
<p>3.) It seems that a typical Hispanic person is much more likely than person of other races to work in Farming, Fishing and forestry occupations. They are also quite likely compared to other races to engage in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations, construction and extraction operations, and material moving operations. <br />
</p>
<p>4.) It seems that a typical Hispanic person is much less likely than persons of other races to work in health diagnosing and treating practitioners and other technical occupations, business and financial operations, computer and mathematical occupations, legal occupations, art, design, entertainment, sports, and media occupations, architecture and engineering occupations, and life, physical, and social science occupations. <br />
</p>
<p>5.) It seems that a typical Black person is much more likely than persons of other races to work in fire fighting and prevention and other protective services including supervisors, law enforcement workers including supervisors, healthcare and support occupations, and community and social service occupations. <br />
</p>
<p>6.) It seems that a typical Black person is much less likely than persons of other races to work in architecture and engineering occupations, art, design, entertainment, sports and media occupations, farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, food preparation and serving occupations, life, physical and social science occupations, and legal occupations. <br />
</p>
<p>7.) It seems that a typical Asian person is much more likely than persons of other races to work in computer and mathematical operations, architecture and engineering operations, business and financial operations, health diagnosing and treating practitioners and other technical occupations. <br />
</p>
<p>8.) It seems that a typical Asian person is much less likely than persons of other races to work in Law enforcement occupations, fire fighting and prevention occupations, community and social service occupations, and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations.<br />

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Overview of Salary Distribution</h3>
<p>In order to have an overview of salary distribution according to different occupations in New York City, we draw a Cleveland Dot Plot to show the 10-year-average salary of different occupations first.</p>

<p><strong>Observations on Average Salaries by Occupation in NYC:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Huge Differences in Salary for Different Occupations.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There is a huge difference in salary among certain occupations. The range is up to 72947, which is about 3 times of minimum salary.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Five clusters for salary distribution.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>first</strong> group is <code>Legal</code>, which has much higher average salary compared with all other occupations.</li>
<li>The <strong>second</strong> group includes 7 different occupations, which ranks second in salary levels among all occupations. We can also divide the second group into four sub-groups according to the salary.
<ul>
<li>The first sub-group only includes <code>Health diagnosing and treating practitioners and other technical</code>, which has the second largest salary.</li>
<li>The second sub-group includes <code>Computer and mathematical</code> and <code>Management</code>. They have very similar average salary, the difference in salary of the two occupations is only 810.</li>
<li>The third sub-group includes <code>Law enforcement workers</code>, <code>Business and financial operations</code> and <code>Architecture and engineering</code>. The salary range of this sub-group is also small, it is NA.</li>
<li>The fourth sub-group contains only one occupation, which is <code>Life, physical, and social science</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <strong>third</strong> group contains <code>Arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media</code>, <code>Health technologists and technicians</code>, <code>Education, training, and library</code>, <code>Installation, maintenance, and repair</code>, <code>Community and social service</code> and <code>Construction and extraction</code>. The salary range of this group is 7128.</li>
<li>The <strong>fourth</strong> group contains <code>Office and administrative support</code>, <code>Sales and related</code>, <code>Transportation</code> and <code>Fire fighting and prevention</code>. The salary range of this group is 3932.</li>
<li>The <strong>fifth</strong> group contains <code>Production</code>, <code>Healthcare support</code>, <code>Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance</code>, <code>Material moving</code>, <code>Personal care and service</code>, <code>Farming, fishing, and forestry</code>, <code>Food preparation and serving related</code>.

</li>
</ol>
<p>Top 3:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1.) Legal occupations<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The average salary of workers in legal occupations is increasing monotonically. In this span of years, the rate at which the average salary is increasing is increasing, with a bigger difference betweeen 2015 and 2019 salaries and 2015 and 2010.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2.) Health diagnosing and treating practitioners and other technical occupations<br />

</ul></li>
<li><p>3.) Computer and mathematical occupations<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>This occupation has a monotonically increasing salary trend.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom 3:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1.) Food preparation and serving related occupations<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>This occupation has the lowest salary within the year range in 2010. However, its salary is increasing over time, and from 2015 to 2019, a rather large salary bump was seen compared to the window from 2010 to 2015.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2.) Farming, fishing, and forestry occupations<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The salary for this occupation decreased first and then increased. However, by 2019 the salary didn’t increase enough from 2015 to be as high as it was in 2010.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>3.) Personal care and service occupations<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The salary trend for this occupation also decreased first and then increased. In this case, the salary only dropped a little bit first and then increased a lot. Therefore, generally speaking, the salary of this occupation increased.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to see the salary variances of the 25 occupations in detail, a boxplot is drawn for comparisons.<br />
<br />

<p><strong>Race Proportions by Sector Given Equal Populations:</strong></p>
<p>Salaries that seem prone to dramatic fluctuation over time:<br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  1.) Legal occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  2.) Computer and Mathematical occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  3.) Architecture and engineering occupations</div>
<div class="line-block">  4.) Life, physical, and social science</div>
<div class="line-block">  5.) Farming, fishing, and forestry occupations</div>
<p><br />
Salaries where the number of employees has fluctuated very little:<br />
</p>
<div class="line-block">  1.) Law enforcement</div>
<div class="line-block">  2.) Health technologists and technicians</div>
<div class="line-block">  3.) Installation, maintenance, and repair</div>
<div class="line-block">  4.) Community and social service</div>
<div class="line-block">  5.) Healthcare support</div>
<div class="line-block">  6.) Material moving</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When reading this plot the difference in size between the salaries of the different occupations may make certain variations seem more pronounced than others when this is not necessarily the case. To address this, a second plot has been created in which the box plots are normalized by dividing the salaries in each year by the mean across this sector. While the true numerical variation won’t be apparent, the relative degrees of fluctuation between occupations will become more apparent.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/Yearly%20Normalized%20BoxPlot2-1.png" width="960" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><strong>Observations from salaries in sector per year:</strong></p>
<p>In this plot, the total values of employees working in each field in each year are normalized by their averages. Due to this normalization, it is more clear how the salaries of each occupation type vary over the period from 2010-2019 with respect to themselves.<br />
<br />
1.) Farming, fishing and forestry ranks first in variation in salaries.
This makes sense because this occupation has relatively low salaries, so when normalized, it is more likely to show high variation in salary by years.<br />
<br />
2.) Construction and extraction also has huge variance, even when the average salary for this occupation is not very low.
There are two outliers in this sector, in 2010, it has the lowest salary which is 26284, and in 2018, it has the highest salary which is 56175. Without the two data points, the variance will be much smaller. There might be more buildings under construction in 2018 and much fewer in 2010.<br />
</p>
<p>3.) Healthcare support and Law enforcement workers are the two most stable sectors in salaries.
Among all the occupations, Healthcare support and Law enforcement workers has the smallest variance after normalized. Of all the occupation types, it seems that law enforcement occupations have the most stable salaries. This might be because the salaries for these kinds of jobs are set by the local government, and government jobs tend to have stable and consistent pay.<br />

<div id="monotonicity-in-salary-trends" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2.2</span> Monotonicity in Salary Trends</h4>
<p>It is often thought that salaries typically increase over time. In this plot however, the salaries of occupations which do not have increasing trends over the time period 2010-2019 will be considered. Among all types of occupations, only two types of occupations have lower salaries in the 2019 than in 2010 to 2013, namely, farming, fishing and forestry occupations and healthcare support occupations. Generally speaking, there are two different trends of salaries, namely, a monotonically increasing trend, which includes 18 occupations, and the trend that first decreases then increases, which includes 7 occupations.</p>

In this category, the salaries of some occupations decreased a lot and then increased a little, which makes these categories have a decreasing trend in general. However, for other occupations, the salaries decreased a little first and then increased a lot. For these occupations, they are in an increasing trend in general. To learn more about the exact changing trends of salaries in this group, we draw scatter plots to analyze the trends of these occupations in detail.<br />

<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2.3</span> Percentage Difference by Years</h4>
<p>Along with studying how salaries tend to vary on an absolute scale over the course of years, salary trends can also be investigated from a percent change standpoint. Because different occupations have different base wages, it might be meaningful to percent changes in wages. Each bar in the following plot represents the percent increase or decrease over the course of the years 2010 to 2019.<br />

<strong>Observations from percentage difference of salary via gender:</strong><br />
As can be seen from the above plot, we discover that the majority of these occupations have increased in salaries in the past decade. Only two of these categories have decreased in salaries. Among all the occupations, construction and extraction occupations have seen the biggest percent change in salary from 2010 to 2019, and Healthcare support occupations have had the smallest.<br />

<p>As can be seen from this plot, the place where most occupations see their lowest salary compared to the other counties is Bronx County. While few of the lowest salaries for certain occupations appear in Kings County and New York County, no occupations have the lowest salary in Queens County and Richmond County.<br />
</p>
<p>For the highest salaries within occupation types, the majority of them are in New York County and Richmond County. Several of them also appear in Queens County, but none of them appear in Bronx County and Kings County.<br />
</p>
<p>To see whether there have been changes in the distribution of the highest and lowest wages in different countries, a stacked bar chart over the years 2010-2019 is drawn. Different colors are used to represent different counties.<br />

<p>It can also be discovered that the variations among different boroughs for different occupations are different. Therefore, a bar chart is used to display the degree of variance among different boroughs for all types of occupations. For each occupation, we use the salary in five counties to minus the smallest salary, add them up and divide the sum by 5. Then, we divide the value by the smallest salary to represent the variance of each occupation.<br />

<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.4.2</span> Relation between Percentage Difference of Employment and Salary in Gender</h4>
<p>Intuitively, the gender composition of employees in a profession may be related to the level of wages for each gender. It is desired to analyze if this intuition makes sense. Therefore, two categorical variables are used to represent the two characteristics, namely “Gender Distribution” and “Salary Distribution”. For the category of “Gender Distribution”, there are two values, Male-dominated, which means there are more male employees in this occupation than female employees, and Female-dominated, which means there are more female employees in this occupation than male employees. For the category of “Salary Distribution”, two values are set, Male-higher, which means male employees typically have higher salaries in this occupation, and Female-higher, which means female employees typically have higher salaries in this occupation. Then, a mosaic plot is drawn measure the relation.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /><br />
<br />
From this mosaic plot, it can be seen that there may be some relation between salary distribution and gender composition. However, the characteristic of this connection is against tuition. It seems intuitive to think that in the “Female-higher” salary distribution group, there will be more female-dominated occupations, and in the “Male-higher” salary distribution group, there will be more male-dominated occupations. However, based on what can be observed from looking at this plot, the opposite is actually true.<br />

<li>A broad take away that can be observed from this plot is that as the number of people becoming more highly educated increases, the number of people earning more increases. Also, as the number of people with lower educational credentials increases, the number of people with increasingly lower salaries also increases.<br />
</li>
<li>Considering the plot concerning those with less education than high school, it is clear to see that in years where the number of employees is higher, that the average salary is lower.<br />
</li>
<li>Considering the plot concerning high school graduates, it seems that there exists no clear relationship.<br />
</li>
<li>Considering the plot for those who have completed some college or an associates degree, it seems that for years in which the number of people in this category is higher, the average salary in those years is lower. This relationship appears as a line upon which both males and females lie, however it may be worth noting that they are on opposite sides.<br />
</li>
<li>Considering the plot for Bachelors degree and up, there is a clear and strong relationship. As the number of people educated increase, the average salary in that year will also be higher. This plot is distinct from the one for some college or associates degree because males and females in this case both lie upon their line, which in this plot are both upsloping.<br />

<strong>Observations from Proportion with Bachelors Degree vs Average NYC Salary from 2010-2019:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It seems that in years where the Proportion of people with Bachelor’s Degrees increases, that the average salary is higher. This would suggest that when there are more educated people, the typical person earns more. According to the trend observed in this plot, it seems that the average salary has risen by 1700 dollars for each percentage point increase in bachelors degree education proportion.<br />
</li>
<li>It is worth noting that this linear relationship cannot be certified to be causal and there is no way given this data to make a determination. It can be seen in the next plot that the total number of Bachelor’s Degrees over time is steadily rising over time. Since salaries also tend to rise over time, it isn’t clear that salaries would stop rising if education levels stopped rising.<br />

<strong>Observation of Bachelor’s proportions over time:</strong></p>
<div class="line-block"> It appears that the proportion of people with Bachelor’s Degrees is steadily increasing over time. In the last 10 years the proportion of people with a bachelors has increased by roughly 5%, from around 32.5% to 37.5%. This indicates an average increase of just under half a percent per year.</div>

<strong>Observations from Proportion of Males and Females with Bachelors Degrees from 2010-2019:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It seems that in 2010, a larger proportion of females than men had bachelor’s degrees, and this trend maintains throughout the entirety of the decade. While the proportions are increasing over time for both males and females, it seems that the rate of increase for both genders is relatively equal.<br />
</li>
<li>This is confirmed by the gap between the male and female dots on the graph fluctuating in distance from each other but remaining relatively equally spaced apart. It seems that in NYC, while females have more bachelors degrees, both males and females are becoming more well educated at a similar rate.<br />

<strong>Observations from Difference in Proportion of Females and Males with a Bachelor’s Degree from 2010-2019:</strong></p>
<div class="line-block">  Confirming the observation from the last graph, the difference between the proportion of females and males with a bachelors degree over the decade has seen some minor fluctuation, but overall has remained relatively unchanged. Females have had throughout the course 1.25% to 2.5% higher of a proportion of bachelors degree than men.</div>

<p><strong>Observations on NumEmp vs GDP/NYC GDP Per Capita:</strong></p>
<div class="line-block">  The scatter dot plots above display the relationship between employment and GDP/NYC GDP per capita in different salary categories. From the plots, it can be seen clearly that there is a turning point in the categories of ‘$25000 to $34999’,‘$35000 to $49999’. Before the two categories, the number of employed is in a decreasing trend when GDP/NYC GDP per capita goes up. However, in the groups with higher salaries, the number of employed is in a increasing trend when GDP/NYC GDP per capita goes up.</div>
