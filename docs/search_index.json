From blue collar workers to big corporation executives, and strong representation from almost every ethnicity, New York has it all. In addition to this, it happens to be a city where the municipality as well as federal government sources provide detailed data about the employment landscape.These factors contribute to the New York as a good candidate for to conduct exploratory data analysis. 1.2 Purpose Explore employment and job data in NYC through the period 2010-2019. Potentially draw conclusions about the landscape with regards to employment, demographics, and salary. 1.3 Areas of interest Explore the employment of demographics (e.g: race, gender) and their fluctuations. Potential to find disparities in different demographics employment levels, explore reasons why this might be the case. Connect these disparities to this being a probabilistic tendency based on our intuition, current events at the time, or trends. Explore the employment of people working in different fields. Explore trends in how likely certain sectors are to be employed and how this changes over time. See how this has reacted over our period to current events or trends. Explore disparities by demographic of people working in different fields. Do people of different demographics prefer to work in certain fields? Does this correspond with our intuition on the matter. Explore disparities in unemployment by demographic factors. See if there are demographic groups with a higher propensity for unemployment, explore the reasons as to why this might be the case. Explore disparities in salary across demographics and also across different sectors. 1.4 Data Sources The introduction of raw data and data sources can be found from this GitHub repo: https://github.com/tracy3057/NYC_Employment_Analysis_Book/blob/main/02-data.Rmd "],["data-sources-1.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Process of Data Collection 2.2 Logistics of Data Collection 2.3 Basic Information of Datasets 2.4 Problems with Data", " Chapter 2 Data sources There are four parts of our datasets, namely, number of employed, salary, education and gdp. 2.1 Process of Data Collection List Variables List variables related to employment conditions in New York City, for example, GDP in New York City, occupations, races, ages, genders, education levels, etc. Search with Keywords Search these key words in google and filter suitable data sources. Select the website Find a suitable website for reliable data, in our project, most of the data are from: United States Census (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). Filter the Data Use the Advanced Search function in the website to filter the data we are interested in. 2.2 Logistics of Data Collection Authority Find more official data sources. For example, we came across multiple data sources with the data we want during the searching process, but finally, we selected United States Census, which is the most authoritative one. Primitive Find the most primitive data source. For example, some websites provide data that have been processed. At this time, we will look for more primitive data sets and analyze the original data. Relevance Find the data tables that can show connections between variables. For later analysis, we need to get rid of over summarizing and find the data that can show the relationship between different variables, which requires as many variables as possible in the same data table. Unity Find the website that includes variety aspects of data. It can make the data in different databases more unified. For example, the data can be obtained with a unified data acquisition method in one website, and this will facilitate subsequent data analysis. 2.3 Basic Information of Datasets 2.3.1 numemp Datasets 2.3.1.1 Sources of numemp In our project, we use numemp to represent Number of Employed. The data is divided into different sub-datasets according to years and races. The year range is from 2010 to 2019, and the races include White Alone, Black or African American Alone, Asian Alone, Some Other Race Alone, Two or More Races, White Alone Not Hispanic or Latino, and Hispanic or Latino.

The sub-datasets from 2010 to 2014 use the same organizing method, the sub-datasets from 2015 to 2018 use the same organizing method, the sub-dataset in 2019 use another organizing method. year 2010 to 2014 From year 2010 to 2014, each sub-dataset includes 41 records and 19 variables. The first column is named Label, it shows the names of different education levels. The type of this column is character. The other columns include the information of percentages of different education levels in different counties. The type of these columns are character. ps: The salary data has the data type of character due to the , and % in data. Take the data for in year 2010 as an example, the form of each dataset is as follows: year 2015 to 2018 From year 2015 to 2018, each sub-dataset includes 68 records and 37 variables. The first column is named Label, it shows the names of different education levels. The type of this column is character. The other columns include both percentages and exact number of different education levels in different counties. The type of these columns are character. ps: The salary data has the data type of character due to the , and % in data. Take the data for in year 2010 as an example, the form of each dataset is as follows: year 2019 In year 2019, each sub-dataset includes 68 records and 19 variables. The first column is named Label, it shows the names of different education levels. The type of this column is character.

The type of these columns are character. ps: The salary data has the data type of character due to the , in data. Take the data for in year 2010 as an example, the form of each dataset is as follows: 2.3.4 gdp Datasets 2.3.4.1 Sources of gdp For gdp dataset, we include GDP per capita in both USA and NYC. The raw data of gdp is attached to the following Github repo: https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/tree/main/RawData/gdp The origin data source urls are provided in: https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/blob/main/RawData/gdp/datasource.txt 2.3.4.2 Basic Information Each sub-dataset includes 10 records and 3 variables. Variable names Types of Variables Types of Variables year Numeric year 2010 - 2019 NYC GDP per capita Numeric NYC GDP per capita in different years USA GDP per capita Numeric USA GDP per capita in different years The form of gdp dataset is as follows: 2.4 Problems with Data In the process of processing data, we encounter 5 major problems. 2.4.1 Inconsistency in Occupation Names When visualizing numemp dataset, we discover that for the occupation of Fire fighting and prevention, and other protective service workers including supervisors and Education, training, and library occupations, the value of some years were 0. Therefore, we came back to the origin dataset to check. We discover that for Fire fighting and prevention, and other protective service workers including supervisors, they are named with Firefighting and prevention, and other protective service workers including supervisors in some years, where Fire fighting is different from Firefighting. Also, for Education, training, and library occupations, they are named with Educational instruction, and library occupations in some years, where training is different from instruction in character level. Therefore, we unified these differences and solved this problem. 2.4.2 Formating Problem Caused by File Download For the datasets online, there is an inclusion relationship between the values for Label. As is shown in the example below. However, after downloading the dataset, we cannot maintain this inclusion relationship. Instead, this relation is reflected by different numbers of spaces in each cell, which increases the difficulty of data processing. As is shown in the example below. Also, the downloaded version of dataset does not have suitable column names, for it always combine the title and subtitle together. Therefore, we need to rename each column. 2.4.3 Differences of Table Organizing Methods in Different Years. In the education dataset, the organization of data table in differen years are different. Sometimes we need to multiply percentages by total amount of people in order to get the the number of people with some specific education levels. Sometimes we can use the number of people directly. Therefore, we need to analyze the organizing methods in different years first, then do the data process correspondingly. 2.4.4 Characters in Numbers In salary dataset and education dataset, there are , and % in numbers in raw data. We need to delete the characters and do some numerical conversions for the percentile. 2.4.5 Different Expressions of NAs In some data tables, NAs are represented as (X) or -. We paid attention to the different representations and replaced them with NA for further processing. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Transformation Process 3.2 Transformation Code", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Transformation Process We download the data from the data source and save them as .csv format. We extract the specific rows and columns we need. We deal with the missing data, namely, we fill the NAs by group averages within sub-datasets. We add some columns or rows in the data set. For example, we add a row to tell years and a row to tell races in datasets, when the years and races are only included in dataset names in the original version. We combine sub-datasets into on dataset as a whole. For example, after we add the information of years in different sub datasets, we will combine these data sets into one dataset that contains information of all of these years. For some NAs that still exists, we fill them by the group averages within combined datasets. We do calculations based on the existed variables to get other variables that we want add them as new columns. 3.2 Transformation Code numemp dataset https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/tree/main/DataPreprocessing/Code/NumEmp salary dataset https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/tree/main/DataPreprocessing/Code/Salary education dataset https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/tree/main/DataPreprocessing/Code/education gdp dataset https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/tree/main/DataPreprocessing/Code/gdp "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 ‘numemp’ dataset 4.2 ‘salary’ dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values There are some missing values in the numemp (short for number of employed) dataset and salary dataset. We analyzed the missing data based on the mi package in r and pre-processed the missing values based on jupyter notebook. 4.1 ‘numemp’ dataset 4.1.1 Missing Value Analysis 4.1.1.1 Initial Analysis First, we analyzed the origin version of the dataset, the form of this dataset is as follows. There are nine columns in this dataset. The Bronx County, New York, Kings County, New York, New York County, New York, Queens County, New York and Richmond County, New York provide us with the number of employed in the corresponding county. The Occupations, year, race and Gender columns give us information of each observation. For analysis convenience, we set the Occupations, year, race and Gender columns to NULL, so that we can focus on the missing values of number of employed in different groups. ## NOTE: In the following pairs of variables, the missingness pattern of the first is a subset of the second. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;Bronx.County..New.York&quot; &quot;Richmond.County..New.York&quot; ## [2,] &quot;New.York.County..New.York&quot; &quot;Richmond.County..New.York&quot; B.C..N.Y: Bronx County, New York K.C..N.Y: Kings County, New York N.Y..C.N: New York County, New York Q.C..N.Y: Queens County, New York R.C..N.Y: Richmond County, New York From this plot, we can see that there are missing values in Bronx County, New York, New York County, New York and Richmond County, New York. Also, the majority of the missing values are in Richmond County, New York. For some observations, all of the three values are missing. 4.1.1.2 Further Analysis In order to find a better way to deal with the missing data, we do a further analysis on the missing values. First, we combine the information of counties and races and use the their combinations as new columns. Second, we see the ratio of the number of NAs in each column. ## Bronx _ Asian Kings _ Asian ## 0.0 0.0 ## NY _ Asian Queens _ Asian ## 0.0 0.0 ## Richmond _ Asian Bronx _ African ## 0.2 0.0 ## Kings _ African NY _ African ## 0.0 0.0 ## Queens _ African Richmond _ African ## 0.0 0.8 ## Bronx _ Hispanic Kings _ Hispanic ## 0.0 0.0 ## NY _ Hispanic Queens _ Hispanic ## 0.0 0.0 ## Richmond _ Hispanic Bronx _ Other ## 0.0 0.0 ## Kings _ Other NY _ Other ## 0.0 0.0 ## Queens _ Other Richmond _ Other ## 0.0 1.0 ## Bronx _ Above2 Kings _ Above2 ## 0.6 0.0 ## NY _ Above2 Queens _ Above2 ## 0.2 0.0 ## Richmond _ Above2 Bronx _ White ## 1.0 0.0 ## Kings _ White NY _ White ## 0.0 0.0 ## Queens _ White Richmond _ White ## 0.0 0.0 ## Bronx _ White_not_Hisp.

Queens _ White_not_Hisp. ## 0.0 0.0 ## Richmond _ White_not_Hisp. ## 0.0 As can be seen from the result, all values in group Richmond _ Above2 and group Richmond _ Other are missing. Missing values also appears in Richmond _ Asian, Richmond _ African, Bronx _ Above2 and NY _ Above2. It also shows that the type of these missing data is Missing at Random (MAR), because most of the missing values are in some specific groups. As we can discover, most of the missing values are in the race group of Two or More Races. It might be because very limited amount of people are in this race group, so sometimes it is hard to do effective statistic for this group. Then, we use mi package to visualize the NAs. ## NOTE: In the following pairs of variables, the missingness pattern of the second is a subset of the first. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;Richmond _ Other&quot; &quot;Bronx _ Above2&quot; ## [2,] &quot;Richmond _ Other&quot; &quot;NY _ Above2&quot; Brnx: Bronx County Kngs: Kings County NY: New York County Rchmnd: Richmond County Qns: Queens County As/Asn: Asian Af: African H/Hs/Hsp: Hispanic O/Ot/Oth: Other A2/Ab2: Above two races W/Wh/Wht: White W_H: White_not_Hispanic This visualization shows us that there is no strong pattern of the missing values in each observation. 4.1.2 Pre-process Missing Values Based on the patterns of missing values, we apply different data pre-preprocess methods to different groups of missing values. Below is our strategies for different groups. group Richmond _ Above2 and group Richmond _ Other Strategy: For the missing values in group Richmond _ Above2 (‘Richmond County’ and ‘Two or more races’) and group Richmond _ Other (Richmond County and ‘Some Other Race Alone’), we fill the NAs with 0. Reason: All the values in this group are missing, including values of both genders and all years, so we cannot find a suitable value to represent the missing value. missing values in Bronx County, New York, New York County, New York and Richmond County, New York Strategy: First, we group the dataset by Occupations, race, and Gender, then we calculate the mean value of different years and use that mean value to represent the NAs under each county. Reason: For each combination of Occupation, race and Gender in these counties, there are always some valid data in some years. Therefore, we use the average value of the available years in corresponding groups to represent the missing values. The code of filling missing data in numemp dataset is attached below. https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/blob/main/DataPreprocessing/Code/NumEmp/PreprocessMissingValues.ipynb 4.2 ‘salary’ dataset 4.2.1 Missing Value Analysis 4.2.1.1 Initial Analysis We also analyzed the origin version of this dataset first, the form of this dataset is as follows. There are eight columns in this dataset. The Bronx County, New York, Kings County, New York, New York County, New York, Queens County, New York and Richmond County, New York provide us with the number of employed in the corresponding county. The Occupations, year, and Gender columns give us information of each observation. For analysis convenience, we set the Occupations, year and Gender columns to NULL, so that we can focus on the missing values of number of employed in different groups. ## NOTE: In the following pairs of variables, the missingness pattern of the first is a subset of the second. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;Bronx.County..New.York&quot; &quot;Richmond.County..New.York&quot; ## [2,] &quot;Kings.County..New.York&quot; &quot;Richmond.County..New.York&quot; ## [3,] &quot;New.York.County..New.York&quot; &quot;Richmond.County..New.York&quot; ## [4,] &quot;Queens.County..New.York&quot; &quot;Richmond.County..New.York&quot; From this plot, we can see that there are missing values in Kings County, New York, Queens County, New York and Richmond County, New York. Also, the majority of the missing values are in Richmond County, New York. In some observations, all of the three values are missing. 4.2.1.2 Further Analysis In order to find suitable strategies for dealing with missing data in salary dataset, we change the form of salary dataset. To be specific, we set columns to be years. Each observation shows the corresponding salary of some certain combination of occupation and gender from 2010 to 2019. We do this rearrangement to see if there is a situation that for some specific combination of occupation and gender, all values are missing from 2010 to 2019. First, we change the shape of our dataset. ## NOTE: In the following pairs of variables, the missingness pattern of the second is a subset of the first. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;2013&quot; &quot;2018&quot; * As can be seen from this plot, the majority of missing values concentrate in several observations. We picked these rows out to see if there’s some observations in which all values are missing. Second, we picked out the rows with NAs to see the percentages of the missing values. As can be seen in the result, for the majority of observations with missing values, there are still some valid values there in some certain years. However, there are two rows where all values are missing. Therefore, we pick out the two rows to see their information in detail. Third, we pick out the rows in which all values are missing. ## # A tibble: 1 x 13 ## Occupations Gender county `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Farming, f… Male Richm… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## # … with 3 more variables: `2017` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2018` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2019` &lt;dbl&gt; ## # A tibble: 1 x 13 ## Occupations Gender county `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Farming, f… Female Richm… NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## # … with 3 more variables: `2017` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2018` &lt;dbl&gt;, `2019` &lt;dbl&gt; * As can be seen from the result, the two groups are the male and female in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations in Richmond County. Therefore, for subsequent data pre-process of these two groups, we cannot use the average of other years to replace the missing values. Instead, we will use the average salary of other counties in the same occupation, year, gender group to represent the missing values in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations in Richmond County.\\ 4.2.2 Pre-process Missing Values According to the analysis above, we follow the following steps to do data pre-process. Divide the salary dataset by county. Under each sub-dataset, we group the dataset by Occupations, gender and year, then we calculate the group mean of each group and use the mean values to replace missing values. For some occupations, the salary values of one gender are completely missing. For these occupations, we group the dataset by Occupations and year, and use the group mean to repalce the missing values. Combine the data of each sub-dataset together. For farming, fishing, and forestry occupations in Richmond County, where all values are missing, we plan to use the average salary of other counties in the same occupation, year, gender group to represent the missing values. Therefore, we group the combined dataset by Occupations, gender, county and year. Then we use the group average to replace the missing values. The code of filling missing data in numemp dataset is attached below. https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/blob/main/DataPreprocessing/Code/Salary/Preprocess_MissingValue.ipynb "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Employment 5.2 Salary 5.3 Education 5.4 GDP", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Employment In this sub chapter, occupational employment is examined with respect to boroughs, genders, races, and in aggregate. 5.1.1 Overview of Employment Distribution In order to have an overview of employment distribution according to different occupations in New York City, a Cleveland Dot Plot was drawn to show the 10-year-average of number of employed first. Observations on Number Employed by Occupation in NYC: Huge Differences in Number of Employed in Different Occupations. There is a huge difference in number of employed among occupations. The sector with the biggest number of employed is office and administrative support, and the number of employed is 757015. However, for farming, fishing and forestry, which has the smallest number of employed, there’s only 4864 on average. Three clusters for employment. The first group includes Office and administrative support, Management, Sales and related, which is a group with the biggest number of employed. The second group includes the majority of occupations and have relatively similar number of employed among occupations. The third group contains Farming, fishing, and forestry only, which is the group with the smallest number of employed. Gaps between the three clusters. As can be seen from the plot, the gap between the first group and second group is very large, while the gap between the second and third group is relatively small. Top 3 and Bottom 3 Occupations in Employment: Top 3: Office and administrative support Management Sales and related Bottom 3: Farming, fishing, and forestry Life, physical, and social science Law enforcement workers 5.1.2 Analysis on Employment by Years Employment tends to change over time. So one area of analysis that was performed was to examine employment throughout the years 2010-2019. 5.1.2.1 General Trend of Employment by Years Observations on Number Employed by Occupation NYC through 2010-2019: The most striking observations from this Cleveland dot plot are where there are clear trends over the decade, that coincide with intuition about the general trend of a sector. Some of the most striking trends are: 1.) Production occupations steadily decreasing over the course of the decade, the only sector where the number of employees for 2010 is lowest of the three years. 2.) Material moving occupations steadily increasing over the course of the decade. 3.) Computer and mathematical as well as architecture and engineering occupations quite quickly increasing over the course of the decade especially relative to their size. 4.) Health care support occupations growing at a stagnant rate from 2010 to 2015, but then growing rapidly from 2015 to 2019. 5.) Food preparation and serving related occupations growing steadily from 2010 to 2019. In order to see the employment variances of the 25 occupations in detail, a boxplot is drawn. Observations from Boxplot of number working in sector per year: Occupations that seem prone to dramatic fluctuation over time: 1.) Management occupations 2.) Office and administrative support occupations 3.) Health care support occupations 4.) Computer and Mathematical occupations Occupations where the number of employees has fluctuated very little: 1.)Law enforcement 2.)Fire fighting 3.)Building and grounds keeping occupations 4.)Legal occupations Something to be noted when reading this plot is that the number of people working in any particular occupation may change the viewers perception as to what constitutes more variation. To address this, a second plot has been created in which the box plots are normalized by dividing the number employed in each year by the mean across this sector. While the variation in total number employed won’t be apparent, the relative degrees of fluctuation will become more apparent. Observations from number working in sector per year: In this plot, the total values of employees working in each field in each year are normalized by their averages. In doing this, changes in employment in a sector that on an absolute scale would be small, may be more pronounced as a function of variation relative to it’s own size. In this plot, the average quantity across all years is normalized to one for illustrative purposes, which allows for new interpretations and findings: 1.) Fields such as management which had a large absolute spread from the years 2010-2019 aren’t necessarily the ones which seem to display the most variation with respect to themselves. While management had the largest box in the previous plot, it is in the middle of the pack in this one. 2.) Of the fields with the smallest numbers of workers: Farming, fishing and forestry occupations, Life, physical and social science occupations, Law enforcement occupations, firefighting occupations, and architecture and engineering occupations; The spreads across this decade were shown to be much more profound than in the previous plot, that is with the exception of law enforcement workers and firefighting workers. While the boxes grew somewhat in spread, the growth was not even nearly proportional to that of the other fields. This indicates that the number of people working in law enforcement and firefighting is very stable, and this would make sense because a steady supply of people in these roles is necessary. With regards to the other occupations, it also makes sense that relatively unpopulated occupations would be more prone to greater variation as a percent of itself, since relatively few can leave or join, and a big impact can be had. 3.) As a percent of the number of employees working in each sector, the following were most prone to large shifts in number employed: Farming, fishing and forestry Material moving occupations Computer and mathematical occupations Health technologists and technicians Healthcare support occupations By contrast, these professions were the most stable: Legal occupations Sales occupations Law enforcement workers Fire fighters Construction and extraction occupations 5.1.2.2 Monotonicity in Employment Trends From the yearly cleveland dot plot above, all occupations are divided into three categories. The first group is in a monotonous increasing trend, the second group is in a monotonic decreasing trend, and the third group do not have a monotonic trend in number of employed people by years. Monotonically Increasing: Within this group are 14 kinds of occupations: 1. Management Occupations 2. Healthcare support occupations 3. Business and financial operations occupations 4. Computer and mathematical occupations 5. Education, training and library occupations 6. Art, design, entertainment, sports and media occupations 7. Health, design and treating practitioners and other technical occupations 8. Construction and extraction occupations 9. Architecture and engineering occupations 10. Fire fighting and prevention, and other protective service workers including supervisors 11. Community and social service occupations 12. Life, physical, and social service occupations 13. Law enforcement workers including supervisors 14. Farming, fishing and forestry occupations Monotonically Decreasing: Within this group is only one kind of occupation: 1. Production occupations Not Monotonic: Within this group are 10 different occupations: 1. Office and administrative support occupations 2. Food preparation and serving related occupations 3. Transportation occupations 4. Material moving occupations 5. Health technologists and technicians 6. Personal care and service occupations 7. Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations 8. Sales and related occupations 9. Legal occupations 10. Installation, maintenance, and repair occupations Further study is conducted on the group that does not a monotonic trend with line chart. Observations from sectors without clear employment trends: Here are descriptions of how these sectors have fluctuated: 1. Office and administrative support occupations The number of employees in this group was consistently high before 2017, while from 2017 to 2019, the number of employees dropped dramatically. 2. Food preparation and serving related occupations In this group, the peak of the number of employees were present in 2015. 3. Transportation occupations Generally speaking, the number of employees was increasing. However, from 2018 to 2019, there was a rather pronounced drop, which is the reason that the number of employed in 2019 was smaller than that in 2015. 4. Material moving occupations For this group, the number of employees dropped slightly from 2010 to 2011, then increased from 2011 to 2012. Afterwards, the number of employees started to decrease again until 2016. Then there was a sudden increase from 2016 to 2018 and maintained at a high level in 2019 with a subtle decrease. 5. Health technologists and technicians The number of employees was consistently low from 2010 to 2013. Then the number started to increase until 2015 and maintained a relatively high level afterwards. Despite frequent dips and spikes, it seems that the number of employees in this occupation is trending upward on the whole. 6. Personal care and service occupations Generally speaking, the number of employees in this group increased from 2010 to 2016, then it dropped slightly from 2016 to 2017 and then dropped significantly lot from 2017 to 2018, accompanied by another slight drop from 2018 to 2019. 7. Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations From 2010 to 2012, the number of employees in this group was decreasing, then the number increased a lot from 2012 to 2013 and continued to decrease from 2013 to 2016. Then it continued to increase for a little bit again from 2016 to 2017, but returned to a dropping trend from 2017 to 2019. 8. Sales and related occupations The number of employed increased a lot from 2010 to 2011 for this group. Then within the year range from 2011 to 2016, the number remained at a high value, with two relatively low values in 2013 and 2015. However, the number of employed dropped a lot from 2016 to 2018, accompanied by a subtle increase from 2018 to 2019. 9. Legal occupations Generally speaking, the number of employees for this group was relatively stable, the changing pattern was in the shape of a wave. The two troughs were in year 2013 and 2018 and the two crests were in year 2012 and 2016. 10. Installation, maintenance and repair occupations The number of employees in this group was relatively stable as well and the changing pattern was also like the shape of a wave. The trough were in year 2016 and the two crests were in year 2013 and 2015. 5.1.3 Analysis of Employment by Counties Employment also shows different characteristics in different counties. So we also do analysis on employment in different counties. Plot abbreviations key: MBSC: Management, business, science, and arts NRCM: Natural resources, construction, maintenance PTMM: Production, transportation, material moving Note: Each line represents one year. The numbers on the axis represent the proportion of the working population of that county working in each of the categories for that year. The numbers across each sector for each year sum to one. Observations from sector groups employment across counties: Observing this plot, it can be seen that certain counties stand out in terms of how many of their people work in certain areas: New York has great representation in Management, business, science, and arts with roughly 60% of its population routinely working in those fields across 2010-2019, which is at roughly 15% higher than for any other county. Bronx County has great representation in service occupations, with roughly 35% of its population working routinely in this sector, which is at least 10% higher than for any other county. Richmond County and Queens County seem to have good representation in natural resources, construction, and maintenance occupations. New York, perhaps because of the high representation in the management, business, science, and arts cluster has clearly the lowest representation in service, natural resources, construction and maintenance, and production, transportation, management and material moving. New York also has the lowest representation in several years in Sales and Office occupations. Of all the counties, Queens county, Kings county, and Richmond county seem to track each other most, and have the most similar levels of representation across the sector clusters. Of all the counties, New York county and Bronx county seem to be the most different. Across almost each sector, low values for one almost certainly means that high values will appear for the other. 5.1.4 Analysis on Employment by Gender The two genders often have different levels of employment throughout the occupations. In order to have a more comprehensive understanding of these relationships, analysis on genders role in employment will be conducted. Observations on Number Employed by Occupation NYC for different genders: A broad takeaway from studying this plot is that generally men tend to dominate the majority of professions, with 17 occupations being majority male, and only 8 occupations being majority female. The occupations in which females account for the vast majority of employees are Office and administrative support, education, training, and library, healthcare support, and personal care and service. The occupations in which males account for the vast majority of employees are construction and extraction, transportation, and installation, maintenance and repair. Observations from gender composition by occupation: From this plot, the top 10 occupations for males and females in terms of proportional representation can be listed. Top 10 occupations for males: Construction and extraction occupations Installation, maintenance and repair occupations Transportation occupations Material moving occupations Architecture and engineering occupations Fire fighting and prevention, and other protective service workers including supervisors Computer and mathematical occupations Law enforcement workers including supervisors Farming, fishing and forestry occupations Food preparation and serving related occupations Top 10 occupations for females: Healthcare support occupations Personal care and service occupations Health, design and treating practitioners and other technical occupations Education, training and library occupations Health technologists and technicians Community and social service occupations Office and administrative support occupations Life, physical, and social service occupations Business and financial operations occupations Legal occupations 5.1.5 Analysis on Employment by Race Races also have an influence upon employment. In this stacked bar chart, this influence is explored. Observations from Race Proportions by Sector Given Equal Populations: Note: This plot was formed by comparing the proportions of each race group working in each sector. If for a particular sector each group accounts for 0.25 in this plot, then each race group has the same percentage of its people working in that sector. This has the effect of displaying what the race demographics of a sector would look like assuming all races had the same population. 1.) It seems that a typical white person is much more likely than persons of other races to work legal profession compared to other races. They are also quite likely compared to other races to engage in Management occupations, physical, life and social science occupations, and art, design, entertainment, sports and media occupations. 2.) It seems that a typical white person is much less likely than persons of other races to work in health care support occupations, transportation occupations, production occupations, personal care and service occupations, material moving operations, and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations 3.) It seems that a typical Hispanic person is much more likely than person of other races to work in Farming, Fishing and forestry occupations. They are also quite likely compared to other races to engage in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations, construction and extraction operations, and material moving operations. 4.) It seems that a typical Hispanic person is much less likely than persons of other races to work in health diagnosing and treating practitioners and other technical occupations, business and financial operations, computer and mathematical occupations, legal occupations, art, design, entertainment, sports, and media occupations, architecture and engineering occupations, and life, physical, and social science occupations. 5.) It seems that a typical Black person is much more likely than persons of other races to work in fire fighting and prevention and other protective services including supervisors, law enforcement workers including supervisors, healthcare and support occupations, and community and social service occupations. 6.) It seems that a typical Black person is much less likely than persons of other races to work in architecture and engineering occupations, art, design, entertainment, sports and media occupations, farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, food preparation and serving occupations, life, physical and social science occupations, and legal occupations. 7.) It seems that a typical Asian person is much more likely than persons of other races to work in computer and mathematical operations, architecture and engineering operations, business and financial operations, health diagnosing and treating practitioners and other technical occupations. 8.) It seems that a typical Asian person is much less likely than persons of other races to work in Law enforcement occupations, fire fighting and prevention occupations, community and social service occupations, and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations. 5.2 Salary In this sub chapter, Salary is examined across the boroughs, occupations, races, genders with varying degrees of granularity from very specific analyses on races and gender to in aggregate. 5.2.1 Overview of Salary Distribution In order to have an overview of salary distribution according to different occupations in New York City, we draw a Cleveland Dot Plot to show the 10-year-average salary of different occupations first. Observations on Average Salaries by Occupation in NYC: Huge Differences in Salary for Different Occupations. There is a huge difference in salary among certain occupations. The range is up to 72947, which is about 3 times of minimum salary. Five clusters for salary distribution. The first group is Legal, which has much higher average salary compared with all other occupations. The second group includes 7 different occupations, which ranks second in salary levels among all occupations. We can also divide the second group into four sub-groups according to the salary. The first sub-group only includes Health diagnosing and treating practitioners and other technical, which has the second largest salary. The second sub-group includes Computer and mathematical and Management. They have very similar average salary, the difference in salary of the two occupations is only 810. The third sub-group includes Law enforcement workers, Business and financial operations and Architecture and engineering. The salary range of this sub-group is also small, it is NA. The fourth sub-group contains only one occupation, which is Life, physical, and social science The third group contains Arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media, Health technologists and technicians, Education, training, and library, Installation, maintenance, and repair, Community and social service and Construction and extraction. The salary range of this group is 7128. The fourth group contains Office and administrative support, Sales and related, Transportation and Fire fighting and prevention. The salary range of this group is 3932. The fifth group contains Production, Healthcare support, Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance, Material moving, Personal care and service, Farming, fishing, and forestry, Food preparation and serving related. The salary range of this group is 8016. Gaps between the five clusters. From the first group to the fifth group, the salary gap between groups is 11623, 13564, 6048, 11989. Among all the gaps, the biggest one is between group 2 and group 3, and the gap is 13564. The smallest gap is between group 3 and group 4, and the gap is 6048. Highest and lowest salary occupations. Top 3: Legal Health diagnosing and treating practitioners and other technical Computer and mathematical Bottom 3: Personal care and service Farming, fishing, and forestry Food preparation and serving related As can be seen from the plot, the salary range for the top 3 occupations are large. However, for the bottom 3 occupations, the salary range is relatively small. 5.2.2 Analyzing Average Salary from 2010-2019 One of the things that affects salary is time. In this section, analysis will be performed on salary with respect to years and the passage of time. 5.2.2.1 General Trend of Salary from 2010-2019 Observations on Salaries by Occupation NYC through 2010-2019: Salary Trends for Top 3 and Bottom 3 Occupations Top 3: 1.) Legal occupations The average salary of workers in legal occupations is increasing monotonically. In this span of years, the rate at which the average salary is increasing is increasing, with a bigger difference betweeen 2015 and 2019 salaries and 2015 and 2010. 2.) Health diagnosing and treating practitioners and other technical occupations This occupation has a monotonically increasing salary trend. 3.) Computer and mathematical occupations This occupation has a monotonically increasing salary trend. Bottom 3: 1.) Food preparation and serving related occupations This occupation has the lowest salary within the year range in 2010. However, its salary is increasing over time, and from 2015 to 2019, a rather large salary bump was seen compared to the window from 2010 to 2015. 2.) Farming, fishing, and forestry occupations The salary for this occupation decreased first and then increased. However, by 2019 the salary didn’t increase enough from 2015 to be as high as it was in 2010. 3.) Personal care and service occupations The salary trend for this occupation also decreased first and then increased. In this case, the salary only dropped a little bit first and then increased a lot. Therefore, generally speaking, the salary of this occupation increased. In order to see the salary variances of the 25 occupations in detail, a boxplot is drawn for comparisons. Race Proportions by Sector Given Equal Populations: Salaries that seem prone to dramatic fluctuation over time: 1.) Legal occupations 2.) Computer and Mathematical occupations 3.) Architecture and engineering occupations 4.) Life, physical, and social science 5.) Farming, fishing, and forestry occupations Salaries where the number of employees has fluctuated very little: 1.) Law enforcement 2.) Health technologists and technicians 3.) Installation, maintenance, and repair 4.) Community and social service 5.) Healthcare support 6.) Material moving When reading this plot the difference in size between the salaries of the different occupations may make certain variations seem more pronounced than others when this is not necessarily the case. To address this, a second plot has been created in which the box plots are normalized by dividing the salaries in each year by the mean across this sector. While the true numerical variation won’t be apparent, the relative degrees of fluctuation between occupations will become more apparent. Observations from salaries in sector per year: In this plot, the total values of employees working in each field in each year are normalized by their averages. Due to this normalization, it is more clear how the salaries of each occupation type vary over the period from 2010-2019 with respect to themselves. 1.) Farming, fishing and forestry ranks first in variation in salaries. This makes sense because this occupation has relatively low salaries, so when normalized, it is more likely to show high variation in salary by years. 2.) Construction and extraction also has huge variance, even when the average salary for this occupation is not very low. There are two outliers in this sector, in 2010, it has the lowest salary which is 26284, and in 2018, it has the highest salary which is 56175. Without the two data points, the variance will be much smaller. There might be more buildings under construction in 2018 and much fewer in 2010. 3.) Healthcare support and Law enforcement workers are the two most stable sectors in salaries. Among all the occupations, Healthcare support and Law enforcement workers has the smallest variance after normalized. Of all the occupation types, it seems that law enforcement occupations have the most stable salaries. This might be because the salaries for these kinds of jobs are set by the local government, and government jobs tend to have stable and consistent pay. 5.2.2.2 Monotonicity in Salary Trends It is often thought that salaries typically increase over time. In this plot however, the salaries of occupations which do not have increasing trends over the time period 2010-2019 will be considered. Among all types of occupations, only two types of occupations have lower salaries in the 2019 than in 2010 to 2013, namely, farming, fishing and forestry occupations and healthcare support occupations. Generally speaking, there are two different trends of salaries, namely, a monotonically increasing trend, which includes 18 occupations, and the trend that first decreases then increases, which includes 7 occupations. Monotonic Increase 1. Legal occupations 2. Health diagnosing and treating practitioners and other technical occupations 3. Computer and mathematical occupations 4. Management occupations 5. Business and financial operations occupations 6. Architecture and engineering occupations 7. Arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media occupations 8. Education, training, and library occupations 9. Installation, maintenance, and repair occupations 10. Community and social service occupations 11. Construction and extraction occupations 12. Office and administrative support occupations 13. Sales and related occupations 14. Transportation occupations 15. Production occupations 16. Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations 17. Material moving occupations 18. Food preparation and serving related occupations First Decrease Then Increase 1. Law enforcement workers including supervisors 2. Life, physical, and social science occupations 3. Health technologists and technicians 4. Fire fighting and prevention, and other protective service workers including supervisors 5. Healthcare support occupations 6. Personal care and service occupations 7. Farming, fishing, and forestry occupations In this category, the salaries of some occupations decreased a lot and then increased a little, which makes these categories have a decreasing trend in general. However, for other occupations, the salaries decreased a little first and then increased a lot. For these occupations, they are in an increasing trend in general. To learn more about the exact changing trends of salaries in this group, we draw scatter plots to analyze the trends of these occupations in detail. Observations from sectors without clear salary trends: From the above plots, we see both the variations in salaries and the general trends for these occupations. Law enforcement workers including supervisors: For this occupation, the salary is in the trend of a wave. The crests are in year 2011, year 2015, and year 2019. The troughs are in year 2012 and year 2016. Besides this, are two special points for this occupation. The salary dropped a lot from 2015 to 2016, and then returned to normal quickly from 2016 to 2017. The salary was in an decreasing trend from 2017 to 2018, but it did not continue to decrease, instead, it increased a lot from year 2018 to 2019. Life, physical, and social science occupations: For this occupation, the salary is in also in the trend of a wave. At the same time, it is in an increasing trend in general. The crests are in year 2013 and 2018. The troughs are in year 2012 and 2014. Health technologists and technicians: From year 2010 to 2013, the salary of this occupation grew slightly at a steady rate. However, from 2014 to 2015, the salary had a sudden drop. After that, the salary started to increase at a higher rate. Fire fighting and prevention, and other protective service workers including supervisors: The salary of this group is in a waving trend and remains at a certain level in general. The crests are in 2012, 2013 and 2017, and the troughs are in 2011 and 2016. However, there is a special point for this occupation. The salary had a sudden increase from year 2016 to year 2017. Healthcare support occupations: Generally speaking, the salary trend is in a decreasing trend. The crests occurred in year 2010, 2013, and 2015. The troughs occurred in year 2014 and 2017. Personal care and service occupations: Generally speaking, the salary of this occupation is in an increasing trend. It remained relatively stable before 2015, after that, the salary increased at a relatively high speed. Farming, fishing, and forestry occupations: For this occupation, it salary increased a little from 2011 to 2012, and then began to decrease at a high speed from 2012 to 2014. After that, the salary recovered at a lower but steady speed. 5.2.2.3 Percentage Difference by Years Along with studying how salaries tend to vary on an absolute scale over the course of years, salary trends can also be investigated from a percent change standpoint. Because different occupations have different base wages, it might be meaningful to percent changes in wages. Each bar in the following plot represents the percent increase or decrease over the course of the years 2010 to 2019. Observations from percentage difference of salary via gender: As can be seen from the above plot, we discover that the majority of these occupations have increased in salaries in the past decade. Only two of these categories have decreased in salaries. Among all the occupations, construction and extraction occupations have seen the biggest percent change in salary from 2010 to 2019, and Healthcare support occupations have had the smallest. 5.2.3 Analysis of Salary by Counties Observations on Salaries by Occupation NYC for different counties: As can be seen in this plot, for different occupations, the counties with the highest and lowest wages in each occupation are different. For the majority of the occupations, the highest salaries are in New York County and the lowest salaries are in Bronx County. For the relatively low-paid occupations, the highest salaries tend to be in Richmond County. 5.2.3.1 Distribution of the Highest and Lowest Wages in Different Counties A side by side bar chart was drawn to reflect the specific distribution data of the highest and lowest wages in different counties. Observations on the Distribution of the Highest and Lowest wages in Different Counties: As can be seen from this plot, the place where most occupations see their lowest salary compared to the other counties is Bronx County. While few of the lowest salaries for certain occupations appear in Kings County and New York County, no occupations have the lowest salary in Queens County and Richmond County. For the highest salaries within occupation types, the majority of them are in New York County and Richmond County. Several of them also appear in Queens County, but none of them appear in Bronx County and Kings County. To see whether there have been changes in the distribution of the highest and lowest wages in different countries, a stacked bar chart over the years 2010-2019 is drawn. Different colors are used to represent different counties. Observations on the Probability of having the Highest/Lowest Salaries in Different Counties: As can be seen in this plot, from the perspective of each year alone, the situation is slightly different from the overall average, which is reflected in the following aspects. For the highest salary In the previous averaged side by side bar chart, the maximum salary does not lie in Bronx County and Kings County for any occupation. However, as can be seen from the stacked bar chart, in year 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014, there are some occupations with highest salary in Bronx County. Also, except for year 2014 and year 2017, there are some occupations with highest salary in Kings County. For the lowest salary In the previous averaged side by side bar chart, the minimum salary does not lie in Queens County and Richmond County for any occupation. However, as can be seen from the stacked bar chart, in every year but 2013 there are some occupations in which the lowest salary of the five counties for that occupation is in Queens County. Also, in every year but 2018, there are some occupations in which the lowest salary of the five counties for that occupation is in Richmond County. 5.2.3.2 Percentage Difference of Salaries in Different Counties It can also be discovered that the variations among different boroughs for different occupations are different. Therefore, a bar chart is used to display the degree of variance among different boroughs for all types of occupations. For each occupation, we use the salary in five counties to minus the smallest salary, add them up and divide the sum by 5. Then, we divide the value by the smallest salary to represent the variance of each occupation. Observations on Range of Percent Difference in Salaries NYC Counties: Top 5 Highest Ranges of Percent Differences 1.) Sales and related occupations 2.) Legal occupations 3.) Management occupations 4.) Farming, fishing, and forestry occupations 5.) Arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media occupations 2. Bottom 5 Highest Ranges of Percent Differences 1.) Personal care and service occupations 2.) Health technologists and technicians 3.) Community and social service occupations 4.) Food preparation and serving related occupations 5.) Life, physical, and social science occupations 5.2.4 Analyzing Salary by Genders Occupation Average Salaries by Gender NYC: As can be seen in this Cleveland dot plot, the salaries of some occupations vary a lot between different genders, while for other occupations the salaries for the two genders are quite similar. Also, for some kinds of occupations, males have higher salaries and for other kinds of occupations, woman have higher salaries. To have a deeper understanding of these characteristics, we have a deeper analysis on salaries for different genders in different occupations. 5.2.4.1 Percentage Difference of Salaries between Genders A bar chart is used to order the percentage difference of salaries between genders for different occupations. To quantify the difference, the income difference between male and female is divided by the average salary for that occupation. Observations on the Percentage Difference of Salaries for Different Genders: From the horizontal bar chart above, the following observations can be made. For most of the occupations, male employees have higher salaries than female employees. Female employees only have higher salaries in 4 kinds of occupations among the 25 kinds of occupations, namely, Construction and extraction occupations, Installation, maintenance, and repair occupations, Community and social service occupations, and Transportation occupations. Top 5 and Bottom 5 in Magnitude of Percent Difference Top 5 1.) Sales and related occupations 2.) Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations 3.) Material moving occupations 4.) Production occupations 5.)Personal care and service occupations Bottom 5 1.) Transportation occupations 2.) Office and administrative support occupations 3.) Community and social service occupations 4.) Installation, maintenance, and repair occupations 5.) Computer and mathematical occupations 5.2.4.2 Relation between Percentage Difference of Employment and Salary in Gender Intuitively, the gender composition of employees in a profession may be related to the level of wages for each gender. It is desired to analyze if this intuition makes sense. Therefore, two categorical variables are used to represent the two characteristics, namely “Gender Distribution” and “Salary Distribution”. For the category of “Gender Distribution”, there are two values, Male-dominated, which means there are more male employees in this occupation than female employees, and Female-dominated, which means there are more female employees in this occupation than male employees. For the category of “Salary Distribution”, two values are set, Male-higher, which means male employees typically have higher salaries in this occupation, and Female-higher, which means female employees typically have higher salaries in this occupation. Then, a mosaic plot is drawn measure the relation. From this mosaic plot, it can be seen that there may be some relation between salary distribution and gender composition. However, the characteristic of this connection is against tuition. It seems intuitive to think that in the “Female-higher” salary distribution group, there will be more female-dominated occupations, and in the “Male-higher” salary distribution group, there will be more male-dominated occupations. However, based on what can be observed from looking at this plot, the opposite is actually true. 5.3 Education In this section Education trends are examined. The changes in education over time and across genders are studied, and how educational attainment impacts economic measures such as average salaries. Observations from Number Educated vs Salary from 2010-2019 A broad take away that can be observed from this plot is that as the number of people becoming more highly educated increases, the number of people earning more increases. Also, as the number of people with lower educational credentials increases, the number of people with increasingly lower salaries also increases. Considering the plot concerning those with less education than high school, it is clear to see that in years where the number of employees is higher, that the average salary is lower. Considering the plot concerning high school graduates, it seems that there exists no clear relationship. Considering the plot for those who have completed some college or an associates degree, it seems that for years in which the number of people in this category is higher, the average salary in those years is lower. This relationship appears as a line upon which both males and females lie, however it may be worth noting that they are on opposite sides. Considering the plot for Bachelors degree and up, there is a clear and strong relationship. As the number of people educated increase, the average salary in that year will also be higher. This plot is distinct from the one for some college or associates degree because males and females in this case both lie upon their line, which in this plot are both upsloping. Observations from Proportion with Bachelors Degree vs Average NYC Salary from 2010-2019: It seems that in years where the Proportion of people with Bachelor’s Degrees increases, that the average salary is higher. This would suggest that when there are more educated people, the typical person earns more. According to the trend observed in this plot, it seems that the average salary has risen by 1700 dollars for each percentage point increase in bachelors degree education proportion. It is worth noting that this linear relationship cannot be certified to be causal and there is no way given this data to make a determination. It can be seen in the next plot that the total number of Bachelor’s Degrees over time is steadily rising over time. Since salaries also tend to rise over time, it isn’t clear that salaries would stop rising if education levels stopped rising. Observation of Bachelor’s proportions over time: It appears that the proportion of people with Bachelor’s Degrees is steadily increasing over time. In the last 10 years the proportion of people with a bachelors has increased by roughly 5%, from around 32.5% to 37.5%. This indicates an average increase of just under half a percent per year. Observations from Proportion of Males and Females with Bachelors Degrees from 2010-2019: It seems that in 2010, a larger proportion of females than men had bachelor’s degrees, and this trend maintains throughout the entirety of the decade. While the proportions are increasing over time for both males and females, it seems that the rate of increase for both genders is relatively equal. This is confirmed by the gap between the male and female dots on the graph fluctuating in distance from each other but remaining relatively equally spaced apart. It seems that in NYC, while females have more bachelors degrees, both males and females are becoming more well educated at a similar rate. Observations from Difference in Proportion of Females and Males with a Bachelor’s Degree from 2010-2019: Confirming the observation from the last graph, the difference between the proportion of females and males with a bachelors degree over the decade has seen some minor fluctuation, but overall has remained relatively unchanged. Females have had throughout the course 1.25% to 2.5% higher of a proportion of bachelors degree than men. 5.4 GDP In this section how GDP intersects with average salaries is briefly investigated. Observations on NumEmp vs GDP/NYC GDP Per Capita: The scatter dot plots above display the relationship between employment and GDP/NYC GDP per capita in different salary categories. From the plots, it can be seen clearly that there is a turning point in the categories of ‘$25000 to $34999’,‘$35000 to $49999’. Before the two categories, the number of employed is in a decreasing trend when GDP/NYC GDP per capita goes up. However, in the groups with higher salaries, the number of employed is in a increasing trend when GDP/NYC GDP per capita goes up. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Employment by Years 6.2 Salary by Years", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Employment by Years In order to have an idea of the changes of number of employed in different occupations by years, we use an interactive bar chart to show the trends more clearly. When you click on a year, the button will turn palevioletred and the bar chart will provide you with the employment data of that year. The palevioletred colored bars mean the number of employed in this specific occupation is larger than the one of your previous click. Instead, the pink bars represent the number of employed decrease. We’ve also posted this D3 code on vizhub, the link of the D3 code is attached here: https://vizhub.com/tracy3057/690c112af43a42e4a539a0a4c891f77e?edit=files&amp;file=index.js&amp;line Customizing Axes 6.2 Salary by Years Similar to what we’ve done for number of employment, we also draw an interactive bar chart for salaries across different years to show the changing trends. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Throughout the course of this project, a thorough analysis was done on the topics of employment, salary, education, and gdp relating to the population of NYC. Several interesting discoveries were made by exploring the data and creating visualizations to get a better sense of the dynamics and landscape of these areas. Particularly interesting findings were the proportional representation of race groups in different occupations assuming equal population, investigations into the stability of different occupations, investigations into salary percentage differences and how they varied from males to females, and female and male relative proportionality of having a bachelors degree. One limitation of this work is that many of the plots and data are simply estimates. These estimates are within a certain range of confidence, so while they may be fairly representative for data summaries in which a large number of entries were present and the confidence was high, this wasn’t always the case. A more thorough analysis could include a detailed consideration of confidence of each data estimate with relation to how the data is being used. Another limitation of this work is that since many of these trends take place over the course of merely a decade, the analyses in this work are very uncertain to be a good baseline for identifying long term trends and behaviors with respect to what was investigated. However these findings may be contemporarily relevant and provide insight perhaps into the next couple of years and potentially beyond. Future directions for this work, and something that would have been of great interest during this work is to do a similar analysis but find a data source containing a more comprehensive dataset where income, race, age, educational attaintment, gender, and occupation are all linked. This was not the case in this analysis and in some cases, research on some areas such as education and GDP were limited. One lesson learned during the course of this project is that a relatively confined set of data can be permuted in many ways to discover many findings, and that the imagination can be a great asset in finding meaning and intrigue and value from what had been before been a mess of numbers and factors. Another lesson learned is that formatting a large project in RMD is not as easy as it seems. One last lesson learned is that employing this kind of exploratory and visualization work before creating models could very instructive in terms of providing a framework for what to do next. It is the opinion of the authors that with this deep background relating to NYC, that hitting the ground running in taking the next step of the Data Science process will have been aided greatly by this work.
