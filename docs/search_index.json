We extract the specific rows and columns we need. We deal with the missing data, namely, we fill the NAs by group averages within sub-datasets. We add some columns or rows in the data set. For example, we add a row to tell years and a row to tell races in datasets, when the years and races are only included in dataset names in the original version. We combine sub-datasets into on dataset as a whole. For example, after we add the information of years in different sub datasets, we will combine these data sets into one dataset that contains information of all of these years. For some NAs that still exists, we fill them by the group averages within combined datasets. We do calculations based on the existed variables to get other variables that we want add them as new columns. 3.2 Transformation Code numemp dataset https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/tree/main/DataPreprocessing/Code/NumEmp salary dataset https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/tree/main/DataPreprocessing/Code/Salary education dataset https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/tree/main/DataPreprocessing/Code/education gdp dataset https://github.com/tracy3057/STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis/tree/main/DataPreprocessing/Code/gdp "]]
